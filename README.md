# vehicleBuilder

## Description
This project was to create an application that allows the user to create or select a vehicle that can be either a car, a truck or a motorbike. Then the application provides the user with a list of actions that they can perform with their vehicle.

If the user selects a truck, they have the ability to tow any vehicle besides another truck as long as the vehicle weighs less than the towing capacity of the truck.

If the user selects a motorbike, the vehicle is able to perform a wheelie. The application should continue to prompt the user to perform actions until the user selects Exit.
